# Frontend Mentor - Intro Component with Sign Up Form

This is my solution to the [Intro component with sign-up form challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-component-with-signup-form-5cf91bd49edda32581d28fd1) on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenges help developers improve their coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

### The Challenge

The challenge required me to create a responsive sign-up form page with the following features:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on the device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty. The message for this error should say "[Field Name] cannot be empty."
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say "Looks like this is not an email."

## What I Learned

During this project, I learned how to handle form validation using JavaScript and display appropriate error messages to the user. I also improved my skills in responsive web design, implementing hover states, and optimizing the form layout for different screen sizes.

## Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to explore more advanced form validation techniques and implement additional features to enhance the user experience.
